Here, I will provide an abstract level of how I compared the performance of each content generation algorithm and how I made sure each implementation could produce as similar/like-for-like results as possible (and where they \textit{couldn't} do so). I delve into more specifics and quantified data in Chapter \ref{Evaluation}.

\section{What I Was Looking For In The ``Best" Implementation Of My Scenario}

To help determine 

\section{Performance}

With the L-System implementation, I had no problems running the game very quickly on my machine, and quickly got satisfactory results results.

While my Noise implementation was slower than my L-System implementation by a magnitude, 

With Poisson Disk Sampling, the higher the number of rejection samples (that is, the higher the maximum number of times a cell was sampled before it was either accepted or ultimately rejected), the longer it took to generate a complete level layout, and even, due to the nature of the tile map compared to the algorithm's \textit{usual} use (of scattering dots on a plane), it was not maximal (not all points had cells painted for them; some cells had their tiles overwritten as well). Using 8 rejection samples was usually enough to yield a satisfactory level layout while also keeping level creation times to a minimum.

Voronoï Cells took the longest to compute on average. Computations with the Euclidean distance measurement took longer than those measured with the Manhattan distance.

\section{Layouts}

Of the 4 implementations I made, the Noise and Poisson Disk Sampling implementation were by far the most similar, followed by the L-System implementation, and then the Voronoï Cells implementation, which was far and away the most unique.

While the noise implementations varied greatly depending on what settings were used, and the way the implementation was designed allowed for very many possibilities as to how the noise would turn out (and how it would affect the final level), the results that I found produced the most similar results to that of the Poisson Disk Sampling implementation had the following configurations:

\begin{itemize} \label{noisedefaults}
    \item Noise Type (``noise\_type"): Simplex Smooth
    \item Fractal Type (``fractal\_type"): Fractal None
    \item Cellular Distance Type/Function (``cellular\_distance\_type"): Distance Euclidean
    \item Noise Frequency (``noise\_frequency"): 0.894
    \item Tree Cap (``tree\_cap"): -0.048
    \item Building Cap (``building\_cap"): -0.252
    \item Building Overtakes Tree (``building\_overtakes\_tree"): 0.12
\end{itemize}

The default noise frequency in ``FastNoiseLite" is 0.01, which results in smoother and less disparate noise. As seen in Figure \ref{fig:simplexsmooth0.01}, the smoother noise and lower frequency results in a distinct kind of level layout in which represents some of the noise values in the image very clearly, such that tiles (both buildings and trees) are bunched together in partially interconnected groups, forming long, large lines of painted tiles. To describe this as best as possible, it is easy to discern that the level layout was determined from a noise image. Using a higher noise frequency to produce rougher noise, and more disparate level layouts, yields results like in Figure \ref{fig:simplexsmoothdefault1}, which makes it very similar to the layouts yielded in my Poisson Disk Sampling implementation and, to a lesser extent, my L-System implementation. While I personally like the former kind of level layout, part of the aim of this project was to compare in terms of which could produce the most similar, and, compared to the L-System and Poisson Disk Sampling implementations, the Noise implementation with the frequency set to 0.01 was far too distinct, hence the want to change it up.
