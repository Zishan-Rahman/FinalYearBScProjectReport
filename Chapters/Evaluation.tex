\chapter{Results \& Evaluation} \label{Evaluation}

Here I will mention how I tested the small games and made sure they ran as they should.

\section{Software Testing}

Due to the nature of the project (being several implementations of a computer game), the testing behind this project has solely revolved around trial-and-error, messing around with the exported variables in the Godot editor to see how things worked and what configurations worked best for our scenario. This involved taking many screenshots of generated levels and examining things by eye, seeing how layouts compared across implementations.

Despite this, I decided to run some simple performance tests to see how long each algorithm ran. These tests took some of the custom export variables I set and ran them several times, with an average time calculated to the nearest millisecond. For the Noise implementation, these tests are in tables \ref{fig:table1}, in which I paired each noise algorithm with each cellular distance function, and \ref{fig:table2}, in which I paired each noise algorithm with each fractal type.
