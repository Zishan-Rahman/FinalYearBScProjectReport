\chapter{Results/Evaluation}

Here I will mention how I tested the small games and made sure they ran as they should.

\section{Software Testing}

Due to the nature of the project (being several implementations of a computer game), the testing behind this project has solely revolved around trial-and-error, messing around with the exported variables in the Godot editor to see how things worked and what configurations worked best for our scenario. This involved taking many screenshots of generated levels and examining things by eye, seeing how layouts compared across implementations.
