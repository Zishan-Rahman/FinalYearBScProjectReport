\chapter{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues} \label{Issues}
% Your report should include a chapter with a reasoned discussion about legal, social ethical and professional issues within the context of your project problem. You should also demonstrate that you are aware of the regulations governing your project area and the Code of Conduct \& Code of Good Practice issued by the British Computer Society, and that you have applied their principles, where appropriate, as you carried out your project.

\section{Using Other People's Resources}

Throughout my project, I made sure the resources I worked with were freely available to use in an academic context like this.

For example, the Unity tutorial I used as an inspiration of my Godot Poisson Disk Sampling implementation\cite{seblaguetuteYT} has its project files under the MIT License\cite{seblaguetuteGH}, a permissive open-source license which means it can be freely used and adapted with, even commercially.\cite{mitlicense}

As aforementioned, the JavaScript code example I used from the Procedural Content Generation wiki\cite{pcgwikivoronoi}, for my Voronoi Cells implementation, was submitted by an anonymous Wikidot contributor in 2017. Like most if not all of the Wiki's contents, it is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License (all contents of the wiki follow this license unless otherwise specified); that is, the article and its contents (including the JavaScript code example) can be freely used and adapted, subject to the condition that the original source is attributed \textbf{and} that any transformed work, \textit{like my implementation}, \textbf{must} be published under the same or a compatible license.\cite{cc_at_sa_3} Since there are no listed compatible source code licenses I can use in lieu of this license\cite{cc_compat}, I must therefore abide by the license contents of the original article in my source code, since my implementation and the original JavaScript code are similar to a noticeable, although not entirely like for like, degree. I go over how I will release all my project artefacts to the public, as well as the \LaTeX{} source code and BIB\TeX{} citations of this report, in the following section \ref{howrelease}.

Projects I have used as references on a smaller scale were also accounted for; while
