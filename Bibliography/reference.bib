    abstract  = {Task environments developed in Minecraft are becoming increasingly popular for artificial intelligence (AI) research. However, most of these are currently constructed manually, thus failing to take advantage of procedural content generation (PCG), a capability unique to virtual task environments. In this paper, we present mcg, an open-source library to facilitate implementing PCG algorithms for voxel-based environments such as Minecraft. The library is designed with human-machine teaming research in mind, and thus takes a `top-down' approach to generation, simultaneously generating low and high level machine-readable representations that are suitable for empirical research. These can be consumed by downstream AI applications that consider human spatial cognition. The benefits of this approach include rapid, scalable, and efficient development of virtual environments, the ability to control the statistics of the environment at a semantic level, and the ability to generate novel environments in response to player actions in real time.},

We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for 0L, DT0L, and T0L systems to be infinite, and characterize the boundedness of finite classes of such systems. First, we give a pumping lemma for these systems, proving that the language of a system is infinite iff the system is pumpable. Next, we show that the number of steps needed to derive any string in any finite 0L or DT0L system is bounded by a function depending only on the size of the alphabet, and not on the production rules or start string. This alphabet boundedness does not hold for finite T0L systems in general. Finally, we show that every infinite 0L system has an infinite D0L subsystem.},

    abstract     = {We solve the problem of generating a uniform Poisson-disk sampling that is both maximal and unbiased over bounded non-convex domains. To our knowledge this is the first provably correct algorithm with time and space dependent only on the number of points produced. Our method has two phases, both based on classical dart-throwing. The first phase uses a background grid of square cells to rapidly create an unbiased, near-maximal covering of the domain. The second phase completes the maximal covering by calculating the connected components of the remaining uncovered voids, and by using their geometry to efficiently place unbiased samples that cover them. The second phase converges quickly, overcoming a common difficulty in dart-throwing methods. The deterministic memory is O(n) and the expected running time is O(n log n), where n is the output size, the number of points in the final sample. Our serial implementation verifies that the log n dependence is minor, and nearly O(n) performance for both time and memory is achieved in practice. We also present a parallel implementation on GPUs to demonstrate the parallel-friendly nature of our method, which achieves 2.4x the performance of our serial version.},

Further symbolism is introduced to take care of branching filaments as well. Two entirely different models are constructed for a particular branching organism, resembling one of the red algae. These models are compared with reference to the number of states employed, and the presence or absence of instructions for unequal divisions and for inductive relationships among the cells. The importance of a morphogenetic control theory concerning these relationships is emphasized.},
