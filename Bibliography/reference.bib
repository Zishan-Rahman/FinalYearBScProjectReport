	abstract = {In this paper a comparison of selected algorithms used to procedurally generate terrain for video games is presented. The algorithms' performance is tested with two implementation environments: Unity and Godot. Results are aggregated and discussed. Conclusions drawn are of two types: intuitive and counter-intuitive.},
