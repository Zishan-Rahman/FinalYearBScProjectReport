% It is usual to thank those individuals who have provided particularly useful assistance, technical or otherwise, during\\ your project. Your supervisor will obviously be pleased to be acknowledged as he or she will have invested quite a lot of time overseeing your progress.

I would like to thank my supervisor, Senir Dinar, for providing me the guidance I so badly needed to make this project not only the best for my mark, but also one that I thoroughly enjoyed doing very much.

I would also like to thank Kevin Lano, who helped him up when he was down and was able to offer as much additional feedback to him as he could.

I express my dearest thanks to my family and friends, both online and offline, who gave me their wholehearted support throughout my studies and his time at King's College London.

I also would like to thank Kenney, for providing the huge tile set asset used in all of the algorithm implementations for free (CC0-1.0).

I also want to thank Alexander Gillberg, who gave me the kind permission to adapt a small part of his code for one of the implementations of the chosen scenario, as well as to add the MIT license to a fork of his code.

And, finally, I shall send my sincerest thanks, from the bottom of my heart, to Shaan Vieru, to whom he lovingly dedicates this project. Shaan were so polite and humble, fun to be around and I am sure he would have loved to see the final product. Shine on, you crazy diamond, and fly high among the stars.
