It is usual to thank those individuals who have provided particularly useful assistance, technical or otherwise, during\\ your project. Your supervisor will obviously be pleased to be acknowledged as he or she will have invested quite a lot of time overseeing your progress.

Thanks to my supervisor Senir Dinar, for providing me the guidance I so badly needed to make this project not only the best for my mark, but also one that I enjoy.

Thanks also to Kevin Lano, who helped me up when I was down and was able to offer as much additional feedback as he could.

This project is dedicated to Shaan Vieru. Shaan on, you crazy diamond. You would've loved to see the final product.
