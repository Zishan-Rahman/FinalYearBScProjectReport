% It is usual to thank those individuals who have provided particularly useful assistance, technical or otherwise, during\\ your project. Your supervisor will obviously be pleased to be acknowledged as he or she will have invested quite a lot of time overseeing your progress.

Thanks to my supervisor Senir Dinar, for providing me the guidance I so badly needed to make this project not only the best for my mark, but also one that I enjoy.

Thanks also to Kevin Lano, who helped me up when I was down and was able to offer as much additional feedback as he could.

Thanks also to my family and friends, both online and offline, who gave me their wholehearted support throughout my studies and my time at King's College London.

Thanks to Alexander Gillberg, who gave me the kind permission to adapt a small part of his code for one of the implementations of my scenario, as well as to add the MIT license to a fork of his code.

And, finally, my sincerest thanks, from the bottom of my heart, to Shaan Vieru, to whom I lovingly dedicate this project. You were so polite and humble, fun to be around and I'm sure you would've loved to see the final product. Shine on, you crazy diamond, and fly high among the stars.
