% It is usual to thank those individuals who have provided particularly useful assistance, technical or otherwise, during\\ your project. Your supervisor will obviously be pleased to be acknowledged as he or she will have invested quite a lot of time overseeing your progress.

The author of this report would like to give thanks to his supervisor, Senir Dinar, for providing him the guidance he so badly needed to make this project not only the best for his mark, but also one that he enjoyed doing very much.

He would also like to thank Kevin Lano, who helped him up when he was down and was able to offer as much additional feedback to him as he could.

He expresses his thanks also to his family and friends, both online and offline, who gave him their wholehearted support throughout his studies and his time at King's College London.

He also thanks Kenney, for providing the huge tile set asset used in all of the algorithm implementations for free (CC0-1.0).

He also thanks Alexander Gillberg, who gave him the kind permission to adapt a small part of his code for one of the implementations of his chosen scenario, as well as to add the MIT license to a fork of his code.

% And, finally, his sincerest thanks are sent, from the bottom of his heart, to Shaan Vieru, to whom he lovingly dedicates this project. Shaan were so polite and humble, fun to be around and he is sure he would have loved to see the final product. Shine on, you crazy diamond, and fly high among the stars.
