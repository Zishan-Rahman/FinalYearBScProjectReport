\chapter{Introduction}
%This is one of the most important components of the report. It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader. It should summarise everything that you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background and relevance to other work, and give pointers to the remaining sections of the report, which will contain the bulk of the technical material.

Procedural Content Generation, or PCG, refers to the use of algorithms and programming in lieu of human handiwork to design and implement various contents in video games, such as levels, terrains, trees and cities. A PCG algorithm is ontogenetic when it tries to produce a foreseeable end result as it goes along. For this project, I will be implementing several well-known ontogenetic algorithms in a basic 2D tile-map-oriented RPG-like game, using the open-source Godot game engine, and then comparing how each algorithm carries out the creation of levels in said game, both performance-wise and comparing the kinds of level layouts generated by each algorithm. I aim to weigh up the best algorithm for my chosen scenario based on how similar and how different each implementation of my algorithm provides with its level layouts, and show how I managed to integrate every algorithm into my scenario and adapt the scenario and the algorithm as needed.

\section{Report Structure}

First, I will provide some \hyperref[Background]{background} into the work I chose to do, demonstrating some understanding of PCG in video games and eventually justifying why I chose Godot, why I chose to do a 2D tile map RPG in a PCG context and why I chose to implement each PCG algorithm into my scenario.

In my main \hyperref[Body]{report body}, I will go through firstly how each algorithms works, and secondly go into how I implemented them into my chosen scenario at a surface-level explanation. I go into further detail in the \hyperref[Implementation]{Implementation} section.

In the \hyperref[Design]{Design \& Specification} section, I will firstly go through what I looked for in every implementation of my scenario, in order to be able to compare each implementation with one another and then determine how I ranked each algorithm in the \hyperref[Evaluation]{Evaluation} section.

In the \hyperref[Implementation]{Implementation} section, I will go into further detail than I do in \hyperref[Body]{the report body} as to how I implemented each algorithm and worked around any code issues, including GDScript code snippets where needed.

In the \hyperref[Issues]{Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues} section, I will go through how firstly I worked around any issues with any external code references I used, and how I acted with integrity while doing so. Secondly, I will go through how I plan to make both the dissertation and the artefacts behind it publicly available while still taking care of any potential professional issues. 

In the \hyperref[Evaluation]{Results \& Evaluation} section, I will go through some of the quantifiable results I have obtained in experimenting with my implementations and any custom values I set. I have included these tables in the \hyperref[Appendix]{Appendix}, so as not to break the flow of the report itself. I will also discuss the conclusions I have obtained and how I would rank the algorithms in terms of how they turned out with my scenario, as well as how similar and different the produced level layouts were.

Finally, in the \hyperref[Conclusion]{Conclusion and Future Work} section, I will summarise the conclusions I have obtained earlier, what I have gained as a games programmer and student from this project, and where this project and its aims could be taken further.
