\chapter{Introduction}
%This is one of the most important components of the report. It should begin with a clear statement of what the project is about so that the nature and scope of the project can be understood by a lay reader. It should summarise everything that you set out to achieve, provide a clear summary of the project's background and relevance to other work, and give pointers to the remaining sections of the report, which will contain the bulk of the technical material.

Procedural Content Generation, or PCG, refers to the use of algorithms and programming in lieu of human handiwork to design and implement various contents in video games, such as levels, terrains, trees and cities. A PCG algorithm is ontogenetic when it tries to produce a foreseeable end result as it goes along. For this project, I will be implementing several well-known ontogenetic algorithms in a basic 3D walking simulator game, using the open-source Godot game engine, and then comparing how each algorithm carries out the creation of levels in said game.
